# ShaguPlates

A Vanilla Addon that modifies and extends the default nameplates. Initially started as a CustomNameplates fork to provide a TukUI alike appearance, but now it is an export of the pfUI nameplates which are entirely written from scratch. It includes a lot of features like Elite ("+"), Rare ("R") and Rare Elite ("R+") marks, A non-blocking mouselook on right-click, aswell as classcolor tinted healthbars and integrated castbars (including Spell Icons) for all locales with detection for more than 1000 spells. The setting dialog can be accessed by typing `/shaguplates`.
